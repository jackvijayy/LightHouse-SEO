# introduction

Lighthouse is an open-source tool created by Google. As Google is a reputable company that‚Äôs trusted by many, it makes the result more reliable than other tools. Furthermore, as Google‚Äôs search engine is the leading search engine for the past decade, appearing higher on their search engine will most likely result in more traffic. So, getting a higher score on their performance audit tool can potentially raise the ranking of your website in their search results.

# HowtoUse
Using Lighthouse through Chrome is the easiest method to measure your website‚Äôs performance. First, open any web page that you‚Äôd like to measure
Next, open the devtools either by clicking shift + control + J or F12 on Windows/Linux, or option + command + J or fn + F12 on macOS.

# Performance
Performance focuses on how to make your website load faster. We‚Äôll go over the six important metrics for Performance, what they each entail and how to achieve a better score in each of them.
  # First-Contentful-Paint
   The first contentful paint (FCP) is measured from the moment the user navigates to the web page. It measures how long it takes for the first piece of DOM content to load. The DOM content can include images, 
  non-white canvas elements, and SVG elements.

FCP is measured in seconds. In order for your web page to have a ‚ÄúGreen‚Äù score ‚Äî which means a fast FCP ‚Äî the first piece of DOM content should take at most 1.8 seconds to load. Once it goes above that, it can go to either moderate or slow.

One factor that can affect your website‚Äôs FCP time is fonts. Fonts can take a long time to load, sometimes making the text invisible until it loads. A good way to solve this is by using the CSS property font-display: swap; when declaring your font using @font-face. For example:

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'MyFont';
    font-style: normal;
    font-weight: 400; 
    src: url(MyFont.woff);
    font-display: swap;
}
```
<h2>How To Improve</h2>

  * Minify JavaScript
  * Remove Unused Css
  * Reduced Response Time
  * Eliminate render-blocking resources
  * Reduce server response times (TTFB)
  * Avoid an excessive DOM size
  * Avoid multiple page redirects
   

# Total-Blocking-Time

* The Total Blocking Time (TBT) metric measures the total amount of time after First Contentful Paint (FCP) where the main thread was blocked for long enough to prevent input responsiveness.
By default, Lighthouse stops monitoring TBT after Time to Interactive (TTI), as do some other lab tools that measure page load.

The timeline depicted in the preceding image has five tasks, three of which are Long Tasks because their duration exceeds 50 milliseconds. The next diagram shows the blocking time for each of the long tasks:

 * In the first case, three, 51 ms tasks would have a TBT of 3 milliseconds. Whereas a single, 10-second long tasks would have a TBT of 9950 milliseconds. The larger TBT value in the second case quantifies the worse experience.
 * To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have a Total Blocking Time of less than 200 milliseconds when tested on average mobile hardware.

<h2>How To improve It</h2>

* Reduce the impact of third-party code
* Reduce JavaScript execution time
* Minimize main thread work
* Keep request counts low and transfer sizes small
